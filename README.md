Hexagon map create with 3D hexagon made with blender. And map generator with Unity3D


Hi Everyone.

this is a personal proyect what i looking to develop, a future game if is possible.
in this part i made the script to generate a random hex map. it works fine, but there are some features to made. 

1. Generate the map and safe the position to avoid generate random position every time that play the game.
2. In this first version there are only 5 diferentes places, in next version there goingo to be more. and this part when the map is generated, at least each one of the places would be in the map.
3. Add the camera behavior. the player can move over the whole map.


NOTE:
all texture are copy from internet and their corresponding rights.
